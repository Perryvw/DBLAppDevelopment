1.	Jimmy has feedback on our first deliverable.
2.	In the second half of this week, we have to collect info about who is doing what (planning) and we have to discuss it every meeting (distribution of work).
3.	API + google maps prototyping has been done. Also prototyping on GUI was done. Tasos did some research on implementation as well.
4.	In the design document we have to make UML class and sequence diagrams. Design decisions the most important part. Every reason for every decision has to be documented. 
5.	Most important – Must have’s, then – should have’s. Only after these have been implemented, we can consider could have’s.
6.	Two design documents – architectural and structural design documents.  Nice to have pictures, but they are not the main point.
7.	We should have global meeting in which we all discuss the main points of design, GUI, sequence charts, class diagrams, API’s we use, a client application… etc.
8.	Next meeting: Chair - Tomas, Secretary – Tasos.
